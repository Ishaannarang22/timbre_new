# Architecture

## The voice agent loop
A voice agent is a streaming pipeline that runs many times per second:

```
Mic/Phone audio → [VAD] → [STT] → [LLM] → [TTS] → Speaker/Phone audio
                    ↑                                      │
                    └────────── interruption (barge-in) ───┘
```

- **VAD** (Voice Activity Detection): when did the user start/stop talking? (Silero)
- **STT** (Speech-to-Text): audio → text. Streams partial results for low latency.
- **LLM**: text → response text. Streams tokens.
- **TTS** (Text-to-Speech): text → audio. Streams audio chunks.
- **Transport**: how audio moves between caller and our server.

The hard part isn't wiring it once — it's **latency** (target < ~800ms response),
**interruptions**, and **turn-taking**. Pipecat handles this plumbing for us.

## Phone path (Twilio)
```
Caller ─PSTN─▶ Twilio ──webhook──▶ our server returns TwiML:
                  │                 <Connect><Stream url="wss://us/ws"/>
                  └── opens WebSocket, streams 8kHz μ-law audio ──▶ Pipecat
```
- Twilio Media Streams delivers call audio over a **WebSocket** (8kHz μ-law).
- Pipecat transport: `FastAPIWebsocketTransport` + `TwilioFrameSerializer`
  (handles encoding + resampling to/from what the models want).
- The fragile internet "last mile" is between caller and Twilio — **Twilio owns it**,
  so a plain WebSocket to our server is fine (no WebRTC needed for phone).

## Why Pipecat (vs LiveKit vs raw WebSockets)
- **Pipecat** = the orchestration brain. Vendor-neutral; swap any component in one line.
- **LiveKit** = WebRTC *transport* infra (+ its own agents framework). Use its transport
  when the client is a **browser/app** over the open internet (WebRTC's packet-loss
  resilience + echo cancellation earn their keep there). Not needed for phone.
- **Raw WebSockets** = we'd rebuild interruptions/streaming ourselves. Pipecat wraps it.

## Model strategy (managed now → customized later)
| Slot | Start (works today) | Later (self-host / customize) |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| STT  | **Deepgram** (`DeepgramSTTService`) — NVIDIA speech gated for our key | NVIDIA Nemotron-Speech/Parakeet NIM on AWS GPU |
| LLM  | **Nemotron** via build.nvidia.com (OpenAI-compatible endpoint) | Nemotron NIM on SageMaker JumpStart / Bedrock (fine-tunable) |
| TTS  | **Cartesia Sonic** (`CartesiaTTSService`) — expressive; Aura was too flat | NVIDIA Magpie-TTS NIM on AWS GPU |

> Note: NVIDIA's hosted *speech* models (Magpie/ASR) returned gRPC UNAUTHENTICATED for our
> `nvapi-` key (partner-gated), so STT runs on Deepgram and TTS on Cartesia Sonic (chosen
> over Deepgram Aura, which sounded flat and ignores prosody tags). The Nemotron **LLM** works fine via the hosted API. We converge on
> full-NVIDIA speech when we self-host (M5/M6).

Pipecat decouples transport from pipeline, so swapping managed→self-hosted is mostly config.

## Voice-controlled Mac tools (M4)
The agent can act on the host Mac via a tool **registry** (`src/mac_tools/`). Each tool is a
small, audited function (osascript/shell, injection-safe via `on run argv`) that is
self-describing to the LLM through a Pipecat `FunctionSchema`. Binding spec:
`docs/tooling/CONTRACT.md`.

```
Nemotron (brain) ──tool_call──▶ dispatch() ──▶ runner (osascript/shell) ──▶ macOS
                                   │
                  CONFIRM-class ───┴──▶ ConfirmationBroker (read-back → confirm_action → run)
```
- **Categories:** media, system, display, apps, windows, files, clipboard, screen, web,
  notifications, productivity, messaging, input, network, power.
- **Safety (enforced server-side, not trusted to the LLM):** risky actions (send / delete /
  disruptive) are CONFIRM-gated — staged, read back aloud, and run only after a
  `confirm_action` tool fires. Deletion is Trash-only. Tools are offered ONLY to an authorized
  caller (owner's number); secrets (Keychain / passwords / SSH / `.env`) are a hard carve-out.

## Dynamic tool factory (GLM-5.1)
When the agent lacks a tool, it calls `request_new_tool`; `src/mac_tools/factory.py` asks
**Z.AI GLM-5.1** (reserved for this — never in the voice hot path) to author one module, runs
it through `validator.py` (AST + deny-patterns), writes it to `generated/`, and **hot-registers
it into the live call** (append schema → `context.set_tools(...)` → `llm.register_function`) so
the same call uses it with no daemon restart. GLM gets a live system prompt rendered from the
current registry (kept current in `docs/tooling/glm_factory_prompt.md`).

## Agent memory (cross-call)
`src/agent_memory/` persists calls, turns, tool invocations, and durable facts in local SQLite
(`data/`, git-ignored). A summarizer (Nemotron) compresses each finished call; `recall()`
injects "what to remember about this caller" into the next call's system prompt, and the agent
can query memory live via `recall_memory` / save a fact via `remember_this`.
```
